1. declare variables
2. take 3 arrays - one for waiting time, one for burst time, one for turn around time
3. waiting time for 1st process is always 0.
4. waiting time for next processes is obtained by adding burst time of previous processes.
5. burst time- the amount of time the process uses the processor before it is no longer ready.
turn around time- sum of waiting time and burst time.
